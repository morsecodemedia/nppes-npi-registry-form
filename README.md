# nppes-npi-registry-form
An UX/Development exercise. Instead of having HCPs fill out large, obnoxious forms to opt into a CRM - this example only requires the HCP to supply their NPI number, and we will use the NPPES NPI Registry's API to gather the rest of the information. This allows the HCP to save time by only confirming the information is correct, rather than fill out all the fields manually.
